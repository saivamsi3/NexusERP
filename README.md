# NexusERP

> **Intelligent Demand-to-Delivery Manufacturing Operating System** built for discrete and furniture manufacturing operations.

NexusERP is a modern Flask-based enterprise resource planning platform engineered specifically to solve the coordination and visibility gaps commonly found in factory operations. The default demo data is modeled around **Shiv Furniture**, resolving core coordination friction points across sales, inventory, purchasing, and production.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Factory Control Center**: A unified management dashboard providing real-time visibility into open orders, inventory valuations, active shortages, delayed operations, and manufacturing progress.
*   **Unified Product & Inventory Hub**: Clean tracking of product master records across components (raw materials), work-in-progress (semi-finished), and end products (finished goods), using precise inventory states (`On-Hand`, `Reserved`, and `Free to Use`).
*   **Smart Sales & Reservation**: Sales order workflow enforcing automatic inventory reservation upon confirmation, combined with a **Delivery Risk Predictor** (`Low`, `Medium`, `High` risk metrics) to prevent overpromising delivery times.
*   **Procurement Automation (Smart Purchasing)**: An auto-replenishment engine evaluating Make-to-Stock (MTS) and Make-to-Order (MTO) rules, identifying material shortages, suggesting optimal suppliers, and creating Purchase/Manufacturing Orders.
*   **Bill of Materials (Product Recipes)**: A multi-level costing and recipe structure defining the component list and sequence of operations (e.g., cutting, assembly, painting, packaging) required for each end product.
*   **Kanban Production Board**: A visual shop-floor pipeline mapping manufacturing orders to work centers and tracking real-time status transitions.
*   **Operational Audit Trail**: Comprehensive traceability tracking user actions, entity creation, edits, and state transitions with historical value changes.
*   **AI Operations Copilot**: An intelligent assistant integrated with Google Gemini to query factory status, identify bottlenecks, and suggest next actions in natural language.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install `uv` and Set Up Environment

This project recommends [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver.

#### Install `uv`

*   **macOS / Linux**:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
*   **Windows (PowerShell - Run as Administrator)**:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
*   **Alternative (via pip)**:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

#### Set Up Environment

Initialize the virtual environment and install dependencies:

Using **`uv`** (Recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Using standard **`pip`**:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/nexuserp.db
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
> [!NOTE]
> If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is omitted, the AI Operations Copilot runs in mock response mode for offline testing.

### 3. Initialize and Seed the Database

Prepare the database schemas and populate the Shiv Furniture demo dataset:
```bash
# Using uv
uv run python app/seed/reset_db.py

# Using standard virtual environment
python app/seed/reset_db.py
```

### 4. Start the Application

Run the development server:
```bash
# Using uv
uv run flask --app app.py run

# Using standard virtual environment
python app.py
```
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

### 5. Running Tests

Run the test suite to verify code logic:
```bash
# Using uv
uv run pytest

# Using standard virtual environment
pytest
```
