# NexusERP

**NexusERP** is a Flask-based manufacturing ERP built for factory operations that need one connected place for sales, inventory, purchasing, production, POS, reporting, and role-based administration.

The current demo dataset is shaped around a furniture manufacturing workflow: raw materials, finished goods, bills of materials, sales demand, procurement suggestions, manufacturing orders, work orders, and stock movements.

## What It Does

NexusERP brings the core factory loop into one web app:

- **Command dashboard** for orders, inventory value, shortages, delayed work, and production progress.
- **Product and category management** with raw material and finished goods support.
- **Inventory control** with stock views, adjustments, transfers, low-stock checks, and ledger history.
- **Sales order workflow** with customers, order lines, confirmation, delivery, and reservation logic.
- **Purchasing workflow** with vendors, purchase orders, receiving, and stock updates.
- **Bills of materials** for finished goods costing and production planning.
- **Manufacturing orders and work orders** for factory execution.
- **Procurement automation** for reorder, make-to-stock, and make-to-order planning.
- **Point of sale terminal** for cashier-led retail transactions.
- **Reports and analytics** with KPI services and Chart.js-powered views.
- **Audit logs and permissions** for operational traceability.
- **AI Operations Copilot** that can summarize live ERP state and provide business guidance when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manish-12ys/NexusERP.git
cd NexusERP
```

### 2. Create a local environment

Using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

Or using `pip`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
SECRET_KEY=change-this-in-development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/nexuserp.db
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

`GEMINI_API_KEY` is optional. Without it, the Copilot route returns a local mock response instead of calling Gemini.

### 4. Initialize and seed the database

```bash
uv run python app/seed/reset_db.py
```

If you are using an activated virtual environment without `uv`:

```bash
python app/seed/reset_db.py
```

### 5. Start the app

```bash
uv run flask --app app.py run
```

Or:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open the app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Demo Accounts

Seed data creates operational users for each role.

| Username | Password | Role | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admin` | `admin123` | Admin | User, role, and full-system management |
| `owner` | `owner123` | Business Owner | Dashboard, reports, audit visibility |
| `inventory` | `inventory123` | Inventory Manager | Products, stock, adjustments, procurement |
| `sales` | `sales123` | Sales User | Customers and sales order flow |
| `purchase` | `purchase123` | Purchase User | Vendors, purchase orders, receiving |
| `manufacturing` | `manufacturing123` | Manufacturing User | BOMs, manufacturing orders, work orders |
| `cashier` | `cashier123` | POS Cashier | POS terminal |

## Database Commands

Create tables through the Flask CLI:

```bash
uv run flask --app app.py init-db
```

Create tables and seed demo data:

```bash
uv run flask --app app.py init-db --seed
```

Reset the local SQLite database and reseed the furniture demo catalog:

```bash
uv run python app/seed/reset_db.py
```

Run migrations:

```bash
uv run flask --app app.py db upgrade
```

---

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

The tests use `TestingConfig` with an in-memory SQLite database and seed the role/permission matrix for each test.

---

## Demo Data

The seed scripts create a compact furniture manufacturing dataset, including:

- Raw materials such as wood legs, table tops, screws, wood polish, planks, and cushions.
- Finished goods such as dining tables, office chairs, and coffee tables.
- BOM recipes that calculate component cost for manufactured products.
- Sample customers, vendors, inventory balances, roles, permissions, and demo users.

---

## Configuration Notes

- Local data is stored in `instance/nexuserp.db` by default.
- Set `DATABASE_URL` to use a different database backend.
- Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` outside development.
- Keep `.env`, local SQLite databases, and virtual environments out of Git.
- The repository includes Flask-Migrate scaffolding under `migrations/`.

---

## Development Notes

- Put route-level HTTP behavior in `app/routes/`.
- Put business rules in `app/services/`.
- Keep model relationships and persistence concerns in `app/models/`.
- Use permission checks from `app/utils/decorators.py` for protected workflows.
- Update seed data when adding new roles, permissions, or demo entities.
- Add focused tests under `tests/` for each workflow change.
